			<p>Did you know that filming returned to the actual location of Escobar's death.
When Moura had to film Escobar’s death, it was obviously emotional because it was the culmination of two years of Narcos. Add to that, they filmed the scene on the very spot of Escobar’s real death.

“So of course the scene where Pablo gets killed was really emotional for me because I was saying goodbye to him,” Moura said. “Not only me, but the whole crew that was living with that character for so long. We shot the scene in the very same place where the real Pablo was killed, which emotionally was strong. On the same rooftop where the real Pablo was killed. That was a very emotional scene for me. In that scene, we tried to be — because there was so much footage about it, so in terms of aesthetics — we tried to be as accurate as we could. But the scenes that precede that scene, that come before that scene — scenes that I don’t want to spoil — are scenes that prepared me for what was going to happen to him.”

	        <h2>Narcos will have more seasons</h2>
			<p>Even though the death of Pablo Escobar is inevitable, it’s not the end of Narcos. Drugs remain a big business to this day, and the producers of Narcos can find more interesting stories to tell.

“There are any number of things that can happen after,” Newman said. “We have not committed to one or the other. Obviously there are a lot of other stories in this world that continue on beyond him. In some ways, for me, what they’ve done with Homeland after losing Damian Lewis after season three was amazing. Most of my thinking is about season two, and I haven’t really thought that much about where do we go from here. I just want the best version of season two. In my earliest conception of the project — and it’s been many years; I started this 15 years ago — I had always thought his interconnected universe of they all know each other. Sinaloa was in the heroin business until Colombian cocaine traffickers came to them and said, ‘We want to use your routes. This weighs less and costs more than heroin.’ They all know each other. They all have the same rolodex. Yes, there is the natural connected universe of drug traffic. It’s all over the world. The show is about cocaine as much as it is about Pablo Escobar.”
